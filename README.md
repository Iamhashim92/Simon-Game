Created this simple but very interesting simon game using jQuery.
Stacks are jQuery, HTML and CSS.
you can play the game here - https://iamhashim92.github.io/Simon-Game/
The game creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. 
If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. 
Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over. 
The original version was manufactured and distributed by Milton Bradley and later by Hasbro after it took over Milton Bradley.
